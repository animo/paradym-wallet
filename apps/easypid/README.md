This app was created by [Animo Solutions](https://animo.id/) in the context of the [SPRIN-D Funke â€˜EUDI Wallet Prototypesâ€™](https://www.sprind.org/en/challenges/eudi-wallet-prototypes/). It serves as a prototype for future wallet providers and can be tested/used with our [playground environment](https://funke.animo.id/). For more information on the project reach out to <ana@animo.id>. 

During the project an identity wallet and a test relying party was delivered.

## Install

The prototype app is currently pusblished privately to select parties. If you're a tester for the SPRIN-D Funke project, you should have received the details on installing the app (either directly or via the guidebook). If not, please reach out to us at ana@animo.id.

## Try it out

Here's some resources and tips that might be helpful while testing the app.

### Before you start

- Make sure you are have access to the BDR PID issuer which is behind a firewall
- Have an eID card ready
- Have the [test relying party](https://funke.animo.id/) ready
    - The test relying party enables you to select a credential type and request type to verify the PID credential. 
    - It will display a QR code as well as relevant information, 

### Device Compatibility

#### Android

This app requires devices with:

- Android 8+
- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Biometric support (e.g., fingerprint sensor, face recognition)

Android devices without these features will not be able to run the app.

#### iOS

Compatible with iPhone 5s and later models. This app requires devices with:
- iOS 14+

### While testing

- The very first screen has an option to switch between the C and B' flow for testing purposes. It is located on the left side besides the continue button.
- There is an option to reset the wallet during testing. It is located in the menu, which you can find on the home page.

## Project Structure

The EasyPID wallet is part of a larger monorepo. The EasyPID app is located in the [apps/easypid](apps/easypid) directory.

### EasyPID App

This is the actual EasyPID application. It is built using Expo and React Native.

The app uses file-based routing starting in the [`src/app`](src/app) directory. Each file in this directory is a route within the app. 

E.g. ['src/app/authenticate.tsx'](src/app/authenticate.tsx) is the entry point for the authentication screen.

Initially when the app is opened, the [`src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx`](src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx) is rendered. This is the main layout for the app. If the wallet is not unlocked, the user is redirected to the onboarding (on first launch) or authentication screen (on return).

### Agent

The agent contains the digital identity related wallet functionality. It uses an [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts) agent instance to manage the wallet.

[Aries Askar](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar) is used for cryptographic operations and encrypted storage of the wallet data. 

[Expo Secure Environment](https://github.com/animo/expo-secure-environment) is used to provide support for cryptographic operations using the device's secure environment (HSM, SE, etc.) hidden behind biometric authentication.

Some relevant links:
- [Handling invitations](../../packages/agent/src/invitation/handler.ts) - this is the entry point for most interactions in the app that need to use the agent. E.g receiving and sharing credentials

### Secure Unlock

The secure store package located in [`packages/secure-store`](packages/secure-store) contains logic for secure unlocking and initializing of the wallet. It uses [React Native Keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) under the hood, which integrates with the device's secure APIs for storing sensitive data.

It also contains the logic for deriving the wallet's master key from the user PIN (using KDF). Whenver the wallet is opened, the PIN is required to unlock the wallet.

Alternatively, the derive PIN can be stored in the device's keychcain, allowing the user to retrieve the master key from the keychain and unlock the wallet directly.

Relevant links:
- [Secure Unlock Provider](../../packages/secure-store/secure-wallet-key/SecureUnlockProvider.tsx) - the main entry point for secure unlocking and initialization of the wallet

### App / UI Package

The [app pacakge](packages/app) and [ui pacakge](packages/ui) contain the underlying app UI and screens logic. This code is shared between our existing [Paradym Wallet](apps/paradym) also located in this repository. This allows us to reuse base elements, while still providing custom screens and UI elements in each of the applications.

### PID Options

The C flow supported in the Pardaym Wallet is mostly implemetned in Credo, the underlying identity framework we use. 

For the B' flow, more custom work was needed and this is implemented in the following files:
- [src/crypto/bPrime.ts](src/crypto/bPrime.ts)
- [src/crypto/aes.ts](src/crypto/aes.ts)

The crypto for the B' flow is implemented using Aries Askar.

## Tech stack / base components

The following section lists the software components used to create the EasyPID wallet. The heavy lifting is done by [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts). The most notable dependencies consumed by Credo are the [OpenId4Vc](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/OID4VC) [Mdoc](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/mdoc-cbor-crypto-multiplatform) and [SdJwt](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/sd-jwt-js) libraries. Other notable dependencies include the Animo [Expo Secure Environment](https://github.com/animo/expo-secure-environment), which provides support for cryptographic operations using the device's secure environment (HSM, SE, etc.) hidden behind biometric authentication, and Animo [Ausweis Sdk](https://github.com/animo/expo-ausweis-sdk) for automatic setup and configuration of the Ausweis SDK for iOS and Android in Expo apps.
