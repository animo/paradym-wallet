# WCAG 2.2 Compliance overview

Several resources can be used as a guideline when improving the accessibility of an application. The WCAG and its companion on WCAG for mobile interfaces, and the UAAG and its companion on UAAG for mobile interfaces. 

## TODO

This is our current approach (as well as our recommendations for interested parties to clone/fork the app) for the application in terms of increasing accessibility. From low-hanging fruit to more specific adjustments.

### Easy
- [] All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface.
- [] Text spacing: UI should be designed to handle up to
Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.
- [] Touch targets:
Ensuring that touch targets are at least 9 mm high by 9 mm wide.
Ensuring that touch targets close to the minimum size are surrounded by a small amount of inactive space.
- [] Pass through â€˜accessibility languageâ€™ in React Native
- [] Walk through React Native accessibility docs to see what else can be used: https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility


### Intermediate
- [] 1.3.4. Orientation. Adjusting the design and removing restrictions on viewing orientation (so both landscape and vertical view are enabled).
- [] 4.1.3. Status Messages. Redesign so status messages are shown inline, to make them easier for assistive technologies to discover in general. 
- [] Increase focus area (would help with 2.4.13 Focus appearance)
- [] Provide Viewport History so the user can return to any state in the viewport history that is allowed by the content
- [] Create an accessibility settings page / support user stylesheets

The user can globally set all of the following characteristics of visually rendered text content: 
Text scale with preserved size distinctions (e.g. keeping headings proportional to main font)
Text color and background color, choosing from all platform color options
Font family, choosing from all installed fonts
Line spacing, choosing from a range with at least three values
Allow zoom
This would help with:
1.4.8. Visual presentation
1.4.6 Contrast (enhanced)

### Hard
- []  Create an accessibility settings page for the user to custom set: text size, spacing, background color, foreground color, and disable animations. This would help with:
2.3.3. Animation from interactions â†’ Setting to disable animations
2.4.8. Location â†’ Setting to show breadcrumb type information about location in app
1.1.3 Replace non-text content â†’ setting to replace all images with their alternative text to prevent images blocking when screen is enlarged.
- []  Make a screen to go to the accessibility settings in the onboarding so users can set their required accommodations as early as possible.
- []  Re-evaluate modals and other non-inline display methods
- []  Speech and gesture input gestures

## Current statue

In this overview, each of the WCAG 2.2 success criteria are examined in relation to the Animo wallet. This overview can be used to assert the current level of compliance, as well as the road ahead to full WCAG 2.1 AA and maybe even AAA compliance. 

Three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). The WCAG standard does not necessarily promote every solution to aim for AAA compliance, however, an identity wallet should (in our opinion) aim to reach the highest level of compliance as weâ€™re talking about use cases that feature in every element of day-to-day functioning. Identity wallets (especially government-backed ones) should strive for the highest level of adoption and accessibility.
